This allows developers to sync WordPress media libraries between machines over Amazon S3.

It can also be used for backing up websites or even moving websites between servers

### How Log Flume talks to S3

The setup will ask you to add these constants to your wp-config.php file:

- LOG_FLUME_REGION
- LOG_FLUME_ACCESS_KEY_ID
- LOG_FLUME_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY

You can obtain these details by creating an IAM user. Here is [our guide](https://github.com/logsmith/log-flume/wiki/Getting-AWS-credentials) on how to setup an IAM Amazon user and get the access and secret key that you need.

## Installation

#### 1. Add the Wordpress plugin to your composer file by navigating to your project and running this inside a terminal:

```
composer require logsmith/log-flume
```

#### 2. Activate the plugin via the admin interface, or just run:

```
wp plugin activate log-flume
```

#### 3. Add your credentials to your wp-config file.

And these constants to your wp-config file:

```
define('LOG_FLUME_REGION','eu-west-2'); //London
define('LOG_FLUME_ACCESS_KEY_ID','');
define('LOG_FLUME_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY','');
```

#### 4. Then finally run (you will need the constants above):

```
wp logflume check_credentials
```

#### 5. If the check is successful, you can start the log flume setup:

```
wp logflume create_bucket <bucket_name>
```

`bucket_name` is usually the address of the site you are currently working on ('website.local')

You will also be asked `Create bucket? [y/n]` - supply 'y' if this is a fresh setup. Select N to not do that.

#### 6. Time to sync!

```
wp logflume sync
```

Bucket name is usually the address of the site you are currently using

## Using log-flume to backup a live website

Log-flume can be used to backup a live site as well as sync development assets.

#### 1. Install and setup log-flume

Get log-flume running on local version of the site (using the 'Installation' guide above).

#### 2. Log into the live env

SSH into the live environment and navigate to your WordPress installation.

#### 3. Check local credential work in live env

```
wp logflume check_credentials
```

Run to find any issues.

#### 4. Setup a bucket for the live env

It's always good to separate the dev and live environments.

```
wp logflume create_bucket <bucket_name>
```

Create a fresh bucket with the live URL as the bucket name. For example:

```
wp logflume create_bucket atomicsmash.co.uk
```

#### 5. Setup auto-deletion of SQL files

Depending on how often you run this command, the SQL files will start to build up quickly. You can setup an S3 folder lifecycle to auto-delete files older than X number of days.

```
wp logflume autodelete_sql <number_of_days>
```

We usually usually retain backups for 30 days:

```
wp logflume autodelete_sql 30
```

#### 6. Setting up auto-backup (cron job)

To get the backup command to run on a regular basis, you need to setup a cron job. Use something similar to this:

```
/usr/local/bin/wp logflume backup_wordpress --path=/path/to/www.website.co.uk/
```

If you are using composer in your project then your WordPress core files might be inside a subfolder, please modify the path to reflect this. If WordPress lives inside "/wp/" then the cron job would look like this:

```
/usr/local/bin/wp logflume backup_wordpress --path=/path/to/www.website.co.uk/wp
```

If you are using forge, then simply add to the server scheduling panel:

## Functions

**logflume sync [--direction=<up-or-down>]**
> This function runs `sync` **and** a DB backup.

**logflume backup_wordpress**
> This function runs `sync` **and** a DB backup.

**logflume create_bucket <bucket_name>**
> Created the required bucket and bucket settings for handling media on S3. It's good to use the current hostname.

**logflume select_bucket <bucket_name>**
> Use this to change the bucket that log-flume is currently sync to.

**logflume check_credentials**
> Performs a simple S3 function to make sure it can access the selected bucket

**logflume autodelete_sql**
> Setup a S3 lifecycle to auto-delete from the SQL folder after a number of days.


## Troubleshooting

Are you receiving an error similar to `PHP Fatal error:  Uncaught Error: Class 'Aws\S3\S3Client' not found in /path/to/file`

Make sure you are requiring your autoload.php generated by composer. We usually add this to the top of our wp-config file:

```
require( dirname( __FILE__ ) . '/vendor/autoload.php' );
```
